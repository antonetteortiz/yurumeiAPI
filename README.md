Garifuna Music API

Description: The purpose of the project was to create a restful CRUD API using tools like Mongodb, Express.js, Node.js etc. and deploy it with Heroku. I built this Garifuna Music Directory API creating data of garifuna musicians and their albums. The directory model references artist name, album title, genre, label, producer, year, track list and album artwork. In addition to having full CRUD functionality which allows users to create, read, update, and delete whatever data they would like, it also follows the restful guidelines.

Technologies: MongoDB Heroku Express.js Node.js Mongo Atlas Axios VS code

Required Installations: Fork and clone the repository Inside the directory run: npm init npm install express npm install mongo npm install body-parser Code away
